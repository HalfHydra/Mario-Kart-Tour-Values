# Mario-Kart-Tour-Values
This is a tool to compare your values in the game, and allow you to see what is available on the courses. You can save your data to reupload and not have to enter everything again. 

The tool so far does all of the following:&nbsp;
-Allows you to view your inventory&nbsp;
-Allows you to compare characters, karts, and gliders easier&nbsp;
-Contains a list of courses that you can compare the top shelf and middle shelf items&nbsp;
-Top Shelf Preview mode allows you to quickly glance at every track's topshelves&nbsp;
-Select courses to compare individual ones&nbsp;
-Select a specific driver, kart, or glider and view all top shelf courses for it&nbsp;
-Enter Data to see all the levels of your items on these features&nbsp;
-Check missing values once you have your data inputted&nbsp;
&nbsp;
I am planning to implement these ideas:&nbsp;
-Reverting to previous tour data&nbsp;
-Bonus Points Calculator&nbsp;
-Pipe Simulator&nbsp;
-Close all and open all for courses and inventory menu&nbsp;
&nbsp;
I hope this helps with anything you should need! There is a copy hosted on my github site.&nbsp;
Feel free to make suggestions.&nbsp;
