# Mario-Kart-Tour-Values
This is a tool to compare your values in the game, and allow you to see what is available on the courses. You can save your data to a file and reupload to not have to enter everything again. 

**The tool so far does all of the following:**
- Allows you to view your inventory
- Allows you to compare characters, karts, and gliders easier
- Contains a list of courses that you can compare the top shelf and middle shelf items
- Top Shelf Preview mode allows you to quickly glance at every track's topshelves
- Select courses to compare individual ones&
- Select a specific driver, kart, or glider and view all top shelf courses for it
- Enter Data to see all the levels of your items on these features
- Check missing values once you have your data inputted

**I am planning to implement these ideas:**
- Reverting to previous tour data
- Bonus Points Calculator
- Pipe Simulator&nbsp;
- Close all and open all for courses and inventory menu

I hope this helps with anything you should need! There is a copy hosted on my [github site](https://halfhydra.github.io/MarioKartTourValues/main.html).
Feel free to make suggestions.
