# Mario-Kart-Tour-Values
This is a tool to compare your values in the game, and allow you to see what is available on the courses. You can save your data to a file, in addition to the data saving automatically to your local browser storage (will be cleared upon cache removal). 

Latest Update: Update 2.6.0 support implemented.

**The tool so far does all of the following:**
- Enter and store your data for later (until you clear cache)
- Allows you to view your inventory
- Allows you to compare characters, karts, and gliders easier
- Contains a list of courses that you can compare the top shelf and middle shelf items
- Top Shelf Preview mode allows you to quickly glance at every track's topshelves
- Select courses to compare individual ones
- Select a specific driver, kart, or glider and view all top shelf courses for it
- Enter Data to see all the levels of your items on these features
- Check missing values once you have your data inputted

**I am planning to implement these ideas:**
- Ranked Review - Current Ranked Cups and their courses
- A nudge to enter data before checking missing courses
- Setting to remove certain city courses from missing that do not have more course amounts yet (not tracks you should focus on)
- Reverting to previous tour data
- Bonus Points Calculator
- Pipe Simulator
- Close all and open all for courses and old inventory menu

I hope this helps with anything you should need! There is a copy hosted on my [github site](https://halfhydra.github.io/MarioKartTourValues/main.html).
Feel free to make suggestions.
