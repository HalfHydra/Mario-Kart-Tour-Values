# Mario-Kart-Tour-Values
This is a tool to compare your values in the game, and allow you to see what is available on the courses. You can save your data to a file, in addition to the data saving automatically to your local browser storage (will be cleared upon cache removal). 

Latest Update: Many many quality of life improvements. Extended saving, UI changes, and more options for the different menus.

**The tool so far does all of the following:**
- Enter and store your data for later (until you clear cache)
- Allows you to view your inventory
- Allows you to compare characters, karts, and gliders easier
- Contains a list of courses that you can compare the top shelf and middle shelf items
- Top Shelf Preview mode allows you to quickly glance at every track's topshelves
- Select courses to compare individual ones
- Select a specific driver, kart, or glider and view all top shelf courses for it
- Enter Data to see all the levels of your items on these features
- Check missing values once you have your data inputted
- Ranked Review - Current Ranked Cups and their courses in an easy location
- Bonus Points Calculator - see what the little differences in base points and level truly do!

**I am planning to implement these ideas:**
- Course XP Tracker
- Delete Local Save Data option
- Various settings that make the experience better

I hope this helps with anything you should need! There is a copy hosted on my [github site](https://halfhydra.github.io/MarioKartTourValues/main.html).
Feel free to make suggestions.

Special Thanks to tryso and spotlight for assisting in providing the jsons initially, this saves a lot of time. Additional thanks to demogorgon, hack_nug, and Ampere for some suggestions. 
And lastly, HUGE THANKS to everyone who helped me test this out and provide feedback, as well as how to make the design more accurate to the game.
